                    I started my education journey from Samtse Lower Secondary School, 
                    studying till class 1 and after that I went to Tendruk Central School, studying for only a year. 
                    Furthermore, I also studied at Pemagatshel Middle Secondary School for a year and 
                    after that I went to Dagana, studied at Dagapela Middle Seccondary School 
                    for almost five whole years till I reached class 9. Then finally I came back to Samtse,
                    joining Samtse Higher Secondary School as a class 10 student and studied there till i graduated high school.
                     Finally I got to pursue further education at Samtse College of Education taking the course of 
                     Information Communication Technology at secondary level and training as a future teacher as my career.
